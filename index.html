        <h2>What is Computer Science?</h2>
        <p>Computer Science is an extremely broad subject. It covers topics like algorithms, data structures, databases, cryptography, AI, machine learning, and many more. 
            The concepts and theory involved are often very abstract. This can be a problem - our caveman brains are generally better suited for learning concrete examples and objects, 
            which can make learning these abstract computing ideas difficult. Wherever possible, a concrete example, object, or metaphor will be used to help explain these abstract concepts.

            <strong>You will need to learn the basics before you can even begin to understand the more advanced topics.</strong> This idea is demonstrated in the pyramid below. 
            You can see that before moving to a higher block of the pyramid, you must first have a solid understanding of the blocks below it.

            <p>This pyramid is an example of turning the abtract (the idea of knowledge) into a concrete object (a pyramid) that is easier to understand.</p>
            <!-- Add a pyramid diagram to show foundational knowledge -->
        </p>

            Additionally, each time you start learning a new topic within Computer Science you will essentially be starting from zero knowledge all over again. This can be disheartening, but also exciting! 
            Each topic is quite distinct, although there is overlap in some areas 
            (data structures and algorithms, for example). You will need to learn a lot of new concepts and terminology each time you start learning a new topic.
