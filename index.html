    <!-- Key questions to answer -->
    <h2>What is Computer Science?</h2>
    <p>Computer Science is an extremely broad subject. It covers topics like algorithms, data structures, databases, cryptography, AI, machine learning, and many more. 
        <strong>The concepts and theory involved are often very abstract</strong>. Our brains are generally better suited for learning with concrete examples and objects, which can make learning these abstract computing ideas difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
        <!-- Rewrite "fast-moving" -->Computer Science is also a very fast moving field. New technologies and ideas are constantly being developed, and it can be difficult to keep up with the latest trends. 
        This is especially true if you are just starting out - <strong>you will need to learn the basics before you can even begin to understand the more advanced topics.</strong>
    </p> 
    <p>
        Additionally, each time you start learning a new topic within Computer Science you will essentially be starting from zero knowledge all over again. This can be disheartening, but also exciting! 
        Each topic is quite distinct, although there is overlap in some areas 
        (data structures and algorithms, for example). <strong>You will need to learn a lot of new concepts and terminology each time you start learning a new topic.</strong>
